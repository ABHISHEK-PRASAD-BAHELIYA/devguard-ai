# Demo Script (2 Minutes)

Hello judges,

Today I present DevGuard AI — an MCP-powered deployment safety controller built on Archestra.

Before any deployment, DevGuard:

- Connects to GitHub via MCP
- Retrieves commits
- Checks open issues
- Detects risky patterns
- Generates structured deployment recommendation

This ensures safe, governed, and observable AI-assisted DevOps workflows.

Instead of blindly deploying code, teams now get AI-driven safety validation inside a centralized control plane.

Thank you.
